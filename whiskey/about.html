		<p>Whiskey Feature Switchboard is an interactive IPA chart that allows you to see the binary features of a particular phoneme, or filter the IPA chart by features.</p>
		<p>During my first semesters studying Linguistics, I was introduced to this tool when it was hosted at <a href="https://kllwynog.github.io/elfennau/whiskey.html">https://kllwynog.github.io/elfennau/whiskey.html</a></p>
		<p>Later, that page was taken down, but my colleague Sylvia Page reached out to Klaus Llwynog, the original creator of Whiskey Feature Switchboard, and he sent the source code, so we brought it back to make it accessible to future Linguistics students!</p>
		</br>
		<p>In that same email he said:</p>
		<blockquote>You're more than welcome to use it, modify it, share it, and so forth, so long as credit is given, the licence isn't restricted, etc... Please let me know if you have any thoughts, questions, comments, or feedback! Whiskey is kind of in 'dormant' development, where it's not in active development, but I've also not completely ruled out the idea of returning to it at some unspecified point in the future.</blockquote>
